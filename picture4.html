	<p>This is another piece inspired by <i>"Coraline."</i> I love that movie if you couldn't tell. Animation is great for helping you work on faces, in my opinion it's much easier to learn little facial and hair details when your subject is animated. It doesn't have to be exactly perfect to look right, it can be a little off. Proportions are sometimes ridiculous so you get a feel for what's right and what's wrong. "Are the eyes too big? Is the nose too small?" It's easier for me to understand proportions after drawing so many different types of cartoons. Styles also play a big part in the way an animation is supposed to look, in the end it's all personal preference.</p>
