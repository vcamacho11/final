	<p>This is an older piece I did with soft pastels back in high school. Soft pastels are a little more difficult to work with than any other medium, in my opinion. It was difficult to get detail in there, which I've learned they aren't really for that anyway. However, it is possible to get a beautiful piece out of them. Flowers are one of the easiest things for me to execute. I think it's much easier because they don't really need to be perfect, every flower is different and your interpretation is personal. Your art doesn't have to please everyone.</p>
